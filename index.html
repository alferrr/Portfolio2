      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Information is central to decision-making and organizational success
          (Laudon & Laudon, 2022)
        </li>
        <li>Data → Information → Knowledge (DIKW hierarchy) (Ackoff, 1989)</li>
        <li>IS integrate technology, people, and processes (Alter, 2002)</li>
        <li>
          Support systems provide structured and unstructured decision-making
          assistance (Turban, Sharda, & Delen, 2018)
        </li>

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Raw, unprocessed facts, figures, or symbols with no inherent meaning
            on their own (Shannon, 1948).
          </li>
          <li>
            Can be qualitative (words, categories) or quantitative (numbers,
            measurements).
          </li>
          <li>Example: “25, 28, 30” = isolated numbers without context.</li>
          <li>
            On their own, data do not support decision-making until processed
            (Ackoff, 1989).

        <h3>Information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Data that has been organized, structured, or processed to provide
            meaning and relevance (Ackoff, 1989).
          </li>
          <li>
            It answers basic questions like who, what, where, and when (Rowley,
            2007).
          </li>
          <li>
            Example: Average of “25, 28, 30” = “Average temperature is 27°C.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Information reduces uncertainty and increases understanding
            (Shannon, 1948).

      <div class="block">
        <h3>Knowledge</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information combined with experience, context, interpretation, and
            reflection (Alavi & Leidner, 2001).
          </li>
          <li>It answers the question how.</li>
          <li>
            Example: “If the average temperature is 27°C, air conditioning will
            be needed for office comfort.”
          </li>
          <li>Knowledge guides judgment and decision-making.</li>

      <h2>Information Systems</h2>
      <p>
        An organized combination of people, hardware, software, networks, data
        resources, and processes that collect, store, process, and distribute
        information (Laudon & Laudon, 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
        Supports operational activities, management functions, and
        decision-making at all organizational levels (Alter, 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
        IS are both technical (machines, programs) and social (people,
        organizational structures) (Bostrom & Heinen, 1977).

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        As I made my research, I became aware of how important it is to tell the
        difference between data, information, and knowledge. I used to think of
        them as being the same thing, but after learning about the DIKW
        hierarchy, I realized that data is useless unless it is processed and
        understood. This got me thinking about how I frequently gather knowledge
        in my daily life, whether from social media, education, or personal
        experiences, but the hardest part is interpreting it and using it
        effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studying information systems also opened up my mind. I used to think of
        IS primarily as computers and software, but now I know that it also
        involves people, organizations, and processes. I came to understand from
        the technological and social perspective that technology is only useful
        when people use it effectively. This got me thinking about cooperation
        and group projects, where having the correct tools is useful, but how
        well we work together as individuals is what really makes the
        difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        I gained a better understanding of how organizations make decisions at
        many different levels after learning about support systems like TPS,
        MIS, DSS, and others. The connection of these systems, from managing
        everyday tasks to executive decision making amazed me. For my part, it
        got me thinking about how I may apply comparable strategies in my own
        research beginning with simple facts, turning it into information, and
        then applying it to make better decisions. This research not only
        increased my comprehension of IS but also provided me with useful
        information that I can utilize in my academic and personal life.
